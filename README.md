```Final project for Artificial Intelligence course```

## 📌Background
+ The usual use of facial recognition may be reduced by using photos/videos in front of the scanner
+ Difficulties in Manual Attendance Tracking:
  + There is a risk of human error
  + Employees can commit time theft
  + Manual time entry is very time-consuming
  + Are ineffective and outdated
  + Keyboard and printing errors
  + No review of your eligibility requirements
  + Incorrect Entry of Times
  + Too much paperwork
  + Obsolete Systems
  + Possibility to commit fraud in filling attendance


## 🛠️Problem Statement
- Automated expression recognition (blink, smile) in stills and videos.
- The Face Recognition Attendance System should be able to live video recognition with a couple of function calls.
- Detection of facial features, smooth facial feature tracking in video
- Distinguishing humans from the images/videos that are presented in front of the camera


## 🧭Troubleshooting Flow

## Algorithm implementation
- ```🔎Face Detection:``` Locate faces and draw bounding boxes around faces and keep the coordinates of bounding boxes.
- ```👀Face Recognition:``` Matching with one or more faces by using facial landmarks then the faces are checked in the database.
- ```😋Face Movement:``` Match the movement with the given command.
